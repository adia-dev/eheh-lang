# [eheh-lang - Version 0.1.0 üëæ](#eheh-lang---version-010-)

Lately a lot of new programming languages have been popping up. Some of them are really cool and offer qualities that others do not provide.
My goal is absolutely not to create a new programming language that will be used by millions of people, but rather to learn how to create a programming language by implementing the features that I like from other languages.

For an in-depth look at my progress, you can find the üó∫Ô∏è roadmap [here](#üó∫Ô∏è-roadmap). Additionally, you can explore practical examples of what you can achieve using the language [here](#üì¶-installation-and-run-üöÄ).

## üìñ About

eheh-lang represents my educational endeavor into the realm of programming languages. This dynamically-typed, interpreted, general-purpose programming language serves as a platform for learning and exploration.

I have stumbled upon this book thanks to [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen), it is an amazing book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn how to create a programming language: [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/), it truly is worth buying !!!

I am a big fan of the Rust programming language, so I decided to implement the language in Rust.

There are a lot of features that I would like to implement in the language that comes from others such has:
     
- [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) (I really like the pattern matching and the pipe operator)

- [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) (I also recommend following [Andrew Kelley](https://github.com/andrewrk)'s work, he is an amazing developer and he is doing some really cool stuff with Zig and has some really nice [Talks](https://vimeo.com/649009599))

- [Swift](https://swift.org/) (I like the way you can call methods on objects with the dot syntax)

- [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B?useskin=vector) (Interesting way to manage memory, pointers, namespace with `::`, etc...)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (No limit in terms of integer size)


## [üì¶ Installation and Run üöÄ](#üì¶-installation-and-run-üöÄ)

To install and run your programming language, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, you can install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
The project has been created and maintained with `rustc` and `cargo` [1.69.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.69.0)
It should work with newer versions, but if you encounter any problems, please open an issue.


2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adia-dev/eheh-lang.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd eheh-lang
```

4. Run the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):
```bash
cargo run
```

5. Enjoy! üéâ Here are some examples of what you can do with the language:
```bash
eheh(1)> let add = fn(x, y) { x + y; };

eheh(2)> add(2, 3)
5

eheh(3)> let factorial = fn(n) { if (n == 0) { 1 } else { n * factorial(n - 1); } };

eheh(4)> factorial(5)
120

eheh(5)> let name: string = "eheh-lang";
"eheh-lang"

------------------------------------- WORK IN PROGRESS -------------------------------------

eheh(6)> name |> String::to_uppercase |> String::chars |> Vec::len |> print
9

eheh(7)> name ** 2
"eheh-langeheh-lang"

eheh(8)> let hash_map = { language: "eheh-lang", version: { major: 0, minor: 1, patch: 0 }, year: 2023 };
{language: "eheh-lang", version: {major: 0, minor: 1, patch: 0}, year: 2023}

eheh(9)> hash_map |> Map::each(|key, value| print("{} => {}\n", key, value))
language => eheh-lang
version => {major: 0, minor: 1, patch: 0}
year => 2023

eheh(10)> help
[...]

eheh(11)> exit
~ Prend moi un Yop ~
```

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è There are some pretty amazing warnings and errors too!

```rust
eheh(1)> let add = fn(x, y { x + y; };
error[E01000]: expected `)`, found `{`
  --> src/main.rs:1:17
    |
1   |   let add = fn(x, y { x + y };
    |                   ^ : expected `)`

eheh(2)> if (true) { 1 } else { 2 }
warning[E01000]: Unnecessary parentheses around true
    |
1   |   if (true) { 1 } else { 2 }
    |       ^^^^

eheh(3)> let add = fn(x, y) { x + y; }; // <- define a function, functions are top-level citizens in eheh-lang

eheh(4)> if true {} else { add(1, 2) }
warning[E01002]: The consequence of the if expression is empty. Consider swapping the alternative and consequence branches of the if expression.
    |
1   |   if true {} else { add(1,2) }
    |           ^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
